# Embedded_Tensorflow
## Overview
- A port of Tensorflow Lite for low resource embedded deviecs.

## Rules
- Make small atomic commits and write good log messages. Use the present tense for commit logs. You can make any number of commits as you like to your local copy as it does not affect the other person's work.

- When you think your code is ready to be shared with others, publish it to the upstream repository. 
A good practice is to always pull before you push. This way you keep your repository in sync with others changes.

- Repeat steps 1 and 2.
